Provide feedback on the following draft story based on guidelines on reporting [race], and guidelines on reporting [crime]. [ATTACH GUIDELINES IF YOU CAN BUT ASK IT TO SUGGEST OTHERS]

## Red-teaming

'Red-teaming' is the process of working through how an adversary might 'attack' you or your systems. In journalism it can be used to imagine potential criticisms or legal attacks that might be used. Here's a prompt to red-team a story based on criticisms.

```
Read through this article and red team it for me. Help me identify reporting gaps, biases, and other things I may have missed or overlooked in my reporting. Explain how I can remedy or fix them.
