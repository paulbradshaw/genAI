# Water plans

Each water company has to publish Water Resources Management Plans (WRMPs) - these are gathered here. 

You will need to download Anglian Water and South West Water directly as those are too big to host here. Download from:

For the podcast try this prompt (click Customise on the right under Deep Dive Conversation) - it is just under the character limit for the prompt:

> Your audience is journalists. One presenter is an environmental correspondent, the other a science reporter. You have a sceptical approach and don't accept the claims of companies at face value - be conscious of potential spin and reports leaving out important information. This podcast focuses on potential story angles from the documents, including differences and similarities between different plans, and across time (where plans are older). Mention which document + page information comes from
