# Resources related to generative AI

This repo contains various resources related to the use of generative AI in journalism.

## Generative AI tools

* ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/
  * ChatGPT Playground (tweak settings such as 'temperature'): https://platform.openai.com/playground
  * Custom GPTs: https://chatgpt.com/gpts
* Claude: https://claude.ai/
* Google Gemini: https://gemini.google.com/app
  * Google AI Studio (Gemini, but with more customisation and models): https://aistudio.google.com/
* Microsoft Copilot: https://copilot.microsoft.com/

## GenAI tools: documents

* ChatPDF: https://www.chatpdf.com/
* NotebookLM: https://notebooklm.google.com/

I've created a folder of [documents to try with NotebookLM (etc)](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/genAI/tree/main/docsfornotebooklm). Some suggestions:

* Download the [rules on school uniform](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/genAI/tree/main/docsfornotebooklm/schooluniformrules) and try a prompt asking it to identify potential story ideas from these.
* Download the [royal finances documents](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/genAI/tree/main/docsfornotebooklm/royalfinances) and ask it for story leads or ideas
* Generate a podcast based on water company documents - [see the readme file in that folder for a template prompt](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/genAI/tree/main/docsfornotebooklm/waterplans)
* Download [responses to a consultation on representation and portrayal on the BBC](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/genAI/tree/main/docsfornotebooklm/consultationbbc) and use genAI tools to summarise them, or suggest story ideas

## GenAI tools: coding

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a tool in Google Drive for writing Python and R notebooks. Its built-in AI will suggest code based on your comments and text blocks - you may need to use the built-in Gemini functionality first to activate it. You can also troubleshoot error messages by clicking on the option to have Gemini examine errors and suggest fixes
* Tools for generating regular expressions include [Regex.ai](https://regex.ai/), [RegexGo](https://www.regexgo.com/) and [rgx.tools](https://rgx.tools/)

## GenAI tools: OSINT

* Advanced searches, known as Google Dorks, can be generated with tools like [DorkSearch.com](https://dorksearch.com/) and Henk Van Ess's [AI Research Pilot](https://digitaldigging.org/research/)
* The [Smart Image Sorter](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bellingcat/smart-image-sorter/blob/main/interface.ipynb) was created by Bellingcat to help with image classification (where for example you've scraped a large number of images and want to find those that match your criteria)
